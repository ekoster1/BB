# BB
 To switch branch 
$ git checkout {name of branch} 
we have 4 branches (master, API, database, categories} 
In the database branch there is a commit from a git user alfaisal (this is due to the fact that I (Iqra Rehman) borrowed a friends Macbook and forgot to change the git id to my own in the terminal). After realizing I changed the git credentials in the terminal to Iqra2124.
